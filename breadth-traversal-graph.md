# Challenge 35
## Graphs
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
The breadthFirst method in the Graph class implements a breadth-first traversal algorithm starting from the specified node. 
The traversal explores nodes level by level, visiting all neighbors of a given node before moving on to the next level.
The method returns a collection of nodes, representing the order in which they were visited during the traversal.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
1. The first thing specify the problem
2. Draw simple diagram to understand the idea
3. try to write code in simple terms (pseudo code )
4. Write the whole code using java language
5. Run the code to be sure is it correct
6. write test cases for code and then run it
7. Drawing the data structure in white board



------------------------------------
complexity :
time complexity is O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices, and E is the number of edges.
space complexity is O(V) for the visitedVertices list
