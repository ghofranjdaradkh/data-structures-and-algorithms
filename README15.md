# Challenge 15
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
## Write code to implementation  Binary Tree and BinarySearch tree classes 
first thing we create class Node that have data and  two pointers left and right 
create class binary tree that have three method inorder method which visiting nodes in the order of left , parent, right (LPR )
and preOrder method which visiting nodes parent ,left, right (PLR)and the last method postOrderwhich visiting nodes left right parent(LRP)
create class binary search tree that have two method :
Add method>> It finds the correct location to insert the new value
Contain method>> which check if the given value exists or not

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
1. The first thing specify the problem (implementation stack and queue classes and Node)
2. Draw simple diagram to understand the idea
3. Try to write the code for this part
4. Write the whole code using java language
5. Run the code to be sure is it correct
6. write test cases for code and then run it
7. Drawing the data structure in white board




## Time Complexity (O(n)
## Space Complexity (O(n))


## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code,and examples of it in action -->
