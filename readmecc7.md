# Challenge 7
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
## k-th value from the end of a linked list.
1. Create the LinkedListKth class.
2. Declare the entry point head.
3. Define the constructor for the Node class.
4. Implement the findKthValue method.
5. Count the number of nodes in the linked list using a while loop that iterates through the list, increasing the count until it reaches a null value (end of the list).
6. Handle three cases based on the value of K:
a. If K is negative, throw an exception with the message "K is Negative."
b. If K is equal to or less than the length of the list, find the Kth value from the end of the list and return its data value.
c. If K is greater than the length of the list, throw an exception with the message "K is greater than the length."
7. Create an insert method to insert values into the linked list, allowing you to populate the list with data for finding the Kth value.







## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
1. The first thing specify the problem (search binary)
2. Draw simple diagram to understand the idea of search key
3. Try to write the code for this part
4. Write the whole code using java language
5. Run the code to be sure is it correct
6. write the test cases
6. Drawing the data structure in whiteboard

## it took three hours  and test cases then draw the whiteboard.


## Time Complexity (O( n))
## Space Complexity (O(1))

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
this the output in the terminal :
