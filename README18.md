# Challenge 18
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
## Write code to implementation  Breadth First class
implement  a method called treeFuzzBuzz that take input set of Node (tree)
and return list
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
1. The first thing specify the problem (implementation stack and queue classes and Node)
2. Draw simple diagram to understand the idea
3. Try to write the code for this part
4. Write the whole code using java language
5. Run the code to be sure is it correct
6. write test cases for code and then run it
7. Drawing the data structure in white board




## Time Complexity (O(n)
## Space Complexity (O(n))


## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code,and examples of it in action -->
