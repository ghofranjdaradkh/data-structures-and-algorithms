# Challenge 8
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
## Write code  takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key.return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key or return-1 if the element is not in the array.

1. Create the linkedListZip class.
2. Declare the entry point head.
3. Define the constructor for the class.
4. Implement the append  method that add to the end of linkedList
5. Implement zipLists that take two list as arguments
6. Create a startPoint node to act as the starting point of the merged linked list.
7. Initialize a current node
8. Iterate while both list1 and list2 have nodes:
a. Append the current node from list1 to the merged list then move list1 and current to their next nodes.
b. Append the current node from list2 to the merged list then move list2 and current to their next nodes.
9. If there are remaining nodes in list1, append them to the merged list.
If there are remaining nodes in list2, append them to the merged list.
Return the merged list starting from startPoint.next.
10. create Node class with two attributes
11. implement to string method


## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
1. The first thing specify the problem (search binary)
2. Draw simple diagram to understand the idea of search key
3. Try to write the code for this part
4. Write the whole code using java language
5. Run the code to be sure is it correct
6. Drawing the data structure in white board
7. Drawing the data structure in whiteboard

## it take three hours to deal merge two lists and draw the white board.


## Time Complexity (O(m + n))
## Space Complexity (O(1))

## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code, and examples of it in action -->
