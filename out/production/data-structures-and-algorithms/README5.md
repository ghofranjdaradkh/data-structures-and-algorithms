# Challenge 5
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
## Write code to implementation linkedlist
# single linkedList

Define the SinglyLinkedList class and the Node class within it.
Implement the insert method to add a new node to the beginning of the list.
Implement the includes method to search for a value in the list.
Implement the toString method to create a string representation of the list.
Write test cases for each functionality, following the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
# doubly linkedList 
Define the DoublyLinkedList class and the DoublyNode class within it.
Implement the doublyInsert method to add a new node to the beginning of the list.
Implement the doublyIncludes method to search for a value in the list.
Implement the doublyToString method to create a string representation of the list.
Write test cases for each functionality, following the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
1. The first thing specify the problem (implementation linkedlist)
2. Draw simple diagram to understand the idea
3. Try to write the code for this part
4. Write the whole code using java language
5. Run the code to be sure is it correct
6. write test cases for code and then run it
7. Drawing the data structure in white board >>this step it take time

it takes 4 hours to deal with singly linked list and doubly linked list and draw the white board.


## Time Complexity (O(1)
## Space Complexity (O(1))
