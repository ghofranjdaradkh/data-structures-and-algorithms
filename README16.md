# Challenge 16
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
## Write code to implementation  tree Max class
implement public method to find maximum value in thr tree with no argument then implement private method with node argument and inside the method using 
recursion to recursive until find the max node and return the value , if the tree is empty is throw an exception
create class binary search tree that have two method :
Add method>> It finds the correct location to insert the new value





## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
1. The first thing specify the problem (implementation stack and queue classes and Node)
2. Draw simple diagram to understand the idea
3. Try to write the code for this part
4. Write the whole code using java language
5. Run the code to be sure is it correct
6. write test cases for code and then run it
7. Drawing the data structure in white board




## Time Complexity (O(n)
## Space Complexity (O(n))


## Solution
<!-- Show how to run your code,and examples of it in action -->
